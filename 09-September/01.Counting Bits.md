## 01. Counting Bits

The problem can be found at the following link: [Question Link](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/?envType=daily-question&envId=2023-09-01)

### My Approach

There are two methods to solve this problem

#### 1. We can count number of bits by iterating every number till n and count each set bits in every number

### Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(nlogn)` 
- **Auxiliary Space Complexity**: `O(1)`

### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countBits(int n) {
        vector<int> ans;
        for(int i=0;i<=n;i++){
            int x = i;
            int one =0;
            while(x){
                if(x&1) one++;
                x /=2;
            }
            ans.push_back(one);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```


#### 2. Optimized approch 

Let if we have X and Y in Such a way that,
`X/2 = Y`
then Number of set bits in X - Number of set bit in Y <= 1

```plaintext
eg let X = 7and Y = 3
then 7 / 2 = 3;

7 -> 1 1 1 number of set bit are 3
3 -> 0 1 1 number of set bit are 2

there difference is 3 - 2 <= 1

another eg
X = 12 and y = 6
then 12 / 2 = 6;

12 -> 1100 number of set bit are 2
6 -> 0110 number of set bit are 2

there difference is 2 - 2 <= 1
```

There can be 2 cases
whether X is Odd or Even

1. if X is ODD

then the (LSB) Least Significant Bit will always be set and dividing by 2 means right shifting the number by 1 bit.
so if last bit is set and right shift it by 1 bit than the last set bit will be lost.
therfore the new number Y has 1 set bit less than in compare to X


2. if X is Even

then LSB will be equal to 0, therefore even we do right shift by1 bit then only this 0 bit will be lost and no set bit got lost
so When we have X has Even,

no of set bit in X = no of set bit in Y
and When X is ODD

no of set bit in X = 1 + no of set bit in Y


### Time and Auxiliary Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` 
- **Auxiliary Space Complexity**: `O(1)`


### Code (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countBits(int n) {
        vector<int> ans(n+1);
        ans[0] = 0;

        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            ans[i] = ans[i/2] + i%2;
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
